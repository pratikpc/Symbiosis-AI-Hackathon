Congratulations! to #Tatamotors for not able to understand the problem which I am facing from the time of purchase of the car. They don‚Äôt know how to fix the issue for the car they have manufactured. May be this is only company in planet which doesn‚Äôt know how to treat customers

@TataMotors Pathetic service experience and immaturity in handling customer problems have forced me to sell my Nexon bearing the loss of 2.5 lacs in an year. Even after escalating the issue, nobody cares. That's TATA. You are doing more damage to your brand by losing customers like this.

@TataMotors Here at Tata Motors Service Ambikapur, your working is too slow and they are not so responsive. You have done a great work on your vechiles but the service is not good. I have currently Tata Tigor,no doubt this vechile is very good but service is very bad.
@TataMotors Take your vehicle back as you have sold a vehicle with a manufacturing deffect to me and it is fraud by your dealer to your customer such type of products destroying the image of tata motors in market and public.

@TataMotors I have shared the details in dm
@TataMotors I have also a concern that tyres of my vehicle are also been changed by you dealer as the condition of my vehicle suggest. I must take a legal action against tata motor and your dealer
@vishalskrishna @TataMotors @LandRover I'm not an auto expert. I would very much like to buy a Tata car, but not sure about the quality (Indian not JLR which I can't afford). Fact is the long run Indica/Indigo had has completely spoiled Tata's brand equity.

@BosePratap @TataMotors Drove the Hexa today. And my God what a machine you have created. In terms of ride quality and interior it even beats the Harrier. It just glides over word of the worst roads. I just have 3 suggestions.
An insurance claim for body shop work.
Without any personal request or prior intimation it would have taken 7 days.
With prior intimation, personal request, continuous follow up, got it done in just 1 week. Commitment was 4 days. Is this customer care? @royalsundaram
@TataMotors
@TataMotors @MayankPareek_ @Vivekvivi @BosePratap I have been Requesting TML Person Mr. Chinmaya to help me fix a Working Rear FOG Light! Alas... 12 days &amp; No Response!
FYI.. Each &amp; Every Compact SUV has one.. except Nexon!
Am I Wrong in asking for one?

@TataMotors On one side you say sales are dropping. On other side your dealership says Tiago XZA+ is not available. Waiting for weeks wihtout a clue. What's going on ?
Hey @TataMotors may i have your attention please..
@TataMotors @RNTata2000 This is a revealation that you r using bots to reply to your tweets. Shocking! For every comment I have got the same reply. .....Or, as I mentioned, you r hiring dumbs. https://t.co/Z48KwwLwWk
@TataMotors 
I have been forwarding my concern to your inbox from 2 weeks regarding my tata tiago xz+, AUX cable. There isn't been any followups after your apologies and regrets. 
This is clear misleading concern from you to indian citizens.
