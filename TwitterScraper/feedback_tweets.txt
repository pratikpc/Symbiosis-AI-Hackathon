Congratulations! to #Tatamotors for not able to understand the problem which I am facing from the time of purchase of the car. They don’t know how to fix the issue for the car they have manufactured. May be this is only company in planet which doesn’t know how to treat customers

@TataMotors Pathetic service experience and immaturity in handling customer problems have forced me to sell my Nexon bearing the loss of 2.5 lacs in an year. Even after escalating the issue, nobody cares. That's TATA. You are doing more damage to your brand by losing customers like this.

@TataMotors I have shared the details in dm
@TataMotors I have also a concern that tyres of my vehicle are also been changed by you dealer as the condition of my vehicle suggest. I must take a legal action against tata motor and your dealer
@vishalskrishna @TataMotors @LandRover I'm not an auto expert. I would very much like to buy a Tata car, but not sure about the quality (Indian not JLR which I can't afford). Fact is the long run Indica/Indigo had has completely spoiled Tata's brand equity.

@TataMotors On one side you say sales are dropping. On other side your dealership says Tiago XZA+ is not available. Waiting for weeks wihtout a clue. What's going on ?
Hey @TataMotors may i have your attention please..
@TataMotors @RNTata2000 This is a revealation that you r using bots to reply to your tweets. Shocking! For every comment I have got the same reply. .....Or, as I mentioned, you r hiring dumbs. https://t.co/Z48KwwLwWk
@TataMotors 
I have been forwarding my concern to your inbox from 2 weeks regarding my tata tiago xz+, AUX cable. There isn't been any followups after your apologies and regrets. 
This is clear misleading concern from you to indian citizens.
