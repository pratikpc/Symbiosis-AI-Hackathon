"Road trip to Montreal with new gf. I don't trust my car, so borrow my mother's. Right on the Metropolitain (huge highway there. always full of traffic). Transmission breaks. Can't move car.  
Call a tow truck. Spend ALL our money to get it back where we live. Only have money for subway ride with about 20$ leftover. Decide What the hell, go downtown and buy a pitcher of beer. Turns out a friend of gf was around, so he lent us money and we were able to get back home the next day, hungover and tired."
"Coach bus driver, many breakdowns in many years.
Worst one was crossing the US border at 1 am, coldest night of the year at about -25ºC. Shut the bus off to send everyone through customs. Everyone finishes inspection... bus won't turn back on. The bus terminal on the US side is 5 minutes away from where I am, but they refused to send the American driver who was taking over with another bus to come and rescue us. Instead they send a mechanic from a city 30 mins in to Canada to come and try and fix it. He couldn't. Ultimately around 6 am they send another Canadian driver with a bus from an hour away to come and pick us up. Thanks, dicks."
I live in New York and was going to Baltimore for the weekend. I didnt trust my eclipse to make it that far and back so I took my mothers Lancer. All was great until about an hour into the drive her clutch just fucking died. Ended up having to get towed back home and take my car anyways. It made it there and back without any sort of problems.
"My friends and I rented a cabin in the mountains during winter a few years ago. We get to the village pretty late, it's snowing and we really can't see too well. The instructions to get to the cabin aren't that clear and we can't find it. There was a steep downhill in front of us, and some of us suggested we walk down to see if the cabin is there, but the driver decided to go there by car. We drive down, the cabin isn't there, but we can't go back up because the car is stuck in snow and ice and wouldn't move. We were there, freezing our asses off, lost, with no one around to ask for directions, and the only person who had a little bit of reception was my super cheap friend who insisted we use her phone for a minute to call the owner of the cabin because she didn't want to pay extra charges. For a few minutes I really thought I was going to fall asleep in the cold and never wake up. "
