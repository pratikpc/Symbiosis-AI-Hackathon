I prefer to drive 4 wheel not sure if it consumes a lot of gas.

Is it advisible to use 'heat' liquid before filling petrol in the winters.

I like small cars but the bottom level should be high so the stones on the roads could not hit the muffler.

I believe installing a back view camera is an A plus.

I don't think installing balloons is safer for the driver because at the time of an accident one can't see anything so some other idea should be floated on the floor by an auto engineers.

Front windshield should be able to protect the glair.

High beam front light should be operated only in case of emergencies not always.

Now at the time of purchasing the car I will most certainly check the seats level. Few seats are made uneven which creates a back ach at the time of long driving. Mileage, the design of sideview mirror, space inside and in the back trunk will be a priority.

Just curious to know will there be a 4wd for TATA HARRIER?

As of now, the Harrier does not have a 4x4 variant. As per company policy, we cannot comment on our future product strategies
